                    <p>It's almost Chirstmas time! I've barely thought about it though. Been too busy worrying about real adult things and school. I'm happy to have a break and work on my personal projects. I event went outside! Willingly! That's great for me. I hung out with the homie, went to an unspecified generic major resturant chain, ran errands, and just talked and relaxed. We sat outside a dollar tree and people-watched, it was <i>fucking hilarious</i>. </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>I experimented with some music. I am inspired by this: <a href="https://soundcloud.com/dfaulttttt/babytron-talking-flagrant-dj-ess-remix-prod-dfaultx?si=6bda49ed3d8d401988b515fd8e29a1ad&utm_source=clipboard&utm_medium=text&utm_campaign=social_sharing" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">soundcloud brained rage music</a>. I wanted to make something that had my style but had that bass-boosted unintelligele fun music vibe. So I made something. I have to do vocals for it which is always the part that stresses me out. I'm just afraid of my voice it seems.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Hopefully, it is something I can break, out of. I've been stuggling all year with that. <strong>I know that all artists have been where I am now,</strong> and I just have to work throught it. </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>ANYWAYS, I wish for most people to have to a good holiday.</p>

                    <p>Hello, welcome to the site...This is the first addition to the site's scripture. I don't have much to say right now, other than I'm happy I could "finish" this project. Truly, no art is ever finished. But my perfectionism often puts me in a cycle of constant change and dissatisfaction. It is hard on my mind, it's like feature creep in game development.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p><i>Which makes me happy that the site can finally go live!</i> It was the first project I wanted to get done before before working on art projects. Because of course, I need a place to put them! And I don't want to run to social media first, ever. This is my hub.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Speaking of social media, you might notice that I basically have nothing on any of the pages I linked in the index. That's cuz I just don't post. I'm quiet on the internet and I prefer it that way. But it would be cool to make some freinds. I'm trying to be more social. Maybe I will start posting. <strong>I'm planning to update this site </strong><mark>every Sunday</mark>.</p>
