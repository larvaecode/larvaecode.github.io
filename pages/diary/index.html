                    <p>Hello, welcome to the site...This is the first addition to the site's scripture. I don't have much to say right now, other than I'm happy I could "finish" this project. Truly, no art is ever finished. But my perfectionism often puts me in a cycle of constant change and dissatisfaction. It is hard on my mind, it's like feature creep in game development.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p><i>Which makes me happy that the site can finally go live!</i> It was the first project I wanted to get done before before working on art projects. Because of course, I need a place to put them! And I don't want to run to social media first, ever. This is my hub.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Speaking of social media, you might notice that I basically have nothing on any of the pages I linked in the index. That's cuz I just don't post. I'm quiet on the interet and I prefer it that way. But it would be cool to make some freinds. I'm trying to be more social. Maybe I will start posting. <strong>I'm planning to update this site </strong><mark>every Sunday</mark>.</p>
