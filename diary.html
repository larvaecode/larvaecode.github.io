                <p>I haven't been entering things on this website like I should be. I am trying to get back on top of everything. I need to add more contrast to the site, and make things more readable. So that is what I'm doing. I need to comb over everything again and make sure things are the way they should be. And I need to make it much more mobile friendly. </p>

                <p>I'm going back to classes tommorrow, which is a little daunting. I've been sparsely going to in person classes, and now I have to because I dont have a choice right now. I think this is good for me, no matter how scary it is to me. Sitting in the back with all black, looking like a school shooter. I am going back to creating a schedule for myself because of this. </p>
                <p>I like weed, it is just the truth. It used make me feel good, but the fun parts of it have gone away since I switched to vapes (because the smell). I mostly did it to dance at night, the body high making me feel like I am floating. It is so much fun, and I'm not getting that with a Kream Strawberry Lemonade hitter. So I am done with blinkers, and I am switching to edibles on the weekends again.</p>

                <p>I've been feeling strange lately. I'm wondering if it's the weed, or just the depression I have been feeling. I have a bad habit of slipping into an "alternate universe" in my mind. It happens involuntarily at times. I should probably be worried.</p>
